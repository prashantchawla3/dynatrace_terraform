#  Dynatrace OpenPipeline Terraform Module

This Terraform module provisions and manages **Dynatrace OpenPipeline** resources, including pipelines and endpoints for ingesting and processing various event types:

* Business Events
* Standard Events
* Logs
* SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) Events
* Security Events

The module is **highly configurable** using Terraform variables and supports dynamic configuration of pipelines, processors, and routing rules.

---

##  Resources Created

### 1. `dynatrace_openpipeline_business_events.this`

This resource creates **Business Event Pipelines** which define how custom business telemetry is processed before reaching Dynatrace.

* **Pipelines** may include one or more **processors** (e.g., removing sensitive fields like SSNs).
* Each processor is conditionally applied based on a **matcher** expression (e.g., `"event.type == 'login'"`).

---

### 2. `dynatrace_openpipeline_events.this`

This resource sets up ingestion for **Standard Events** into Dynatrace.

* **Endpoints** define how and where events are ingested.
* **Routing** determines how events are assigned to pipelines.
* **Pipelines** define the actual processing flow.

---

### 3. `dynatrace_openpipeline_logs.this`

This resource provisions **Log Pipelines** to process structured or unstructured application logs.

---

### 4. `dynatrace_openpipeline_sdlc_events.this`

This resource enables ingestion and processing of **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Events** such as build or deploy logs.

* Like standard events, it supports endpoint configuration, pipelines, and routing.

---

### 5. `dynatrace_openpipeline_security_events.this`

This resource provisions pipelines for **security-related event ingestion**, such as threat detection or compliance events.

---

##  How to Use

Create a `main.tf` with:

```hcl
module "dynatrace_pipeline" {
  source = "./path-to-this-module"

  enable_business_events = true
  business_event_pipelines = [
    {
      enabled      = true
      display_name = "Business Events"
      id           = "biz-1"
      processing = [
        {
          description = "Strip passwords"
          enabled     = true
          fields      = ["password"]
          id          = "proc-pass"
          matcher     = "event.type == 'login'"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=readme.md/samples.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=readme.md/samples.tfvars
```

##  Security Notes

* **No secrets or credentials** are stored in this module.
* Sensitive field filtering is handled via processors (e.g., removing `password`, `ssn`).

---

##  Requirements

* Terraform â‰¥ 1.0
* Dynatrace OpenPipeline Terraform Provider
